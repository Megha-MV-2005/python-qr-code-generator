# Python QR Code Generator 🐍📱

## Overview
This project is a Python-based QR Code Generator developed to create scannable QR codes using external libraries.  
The generated QR code encodes a Google Drive link that points to my Python completion certificate, making it easy to share and access digital credentials.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Working with third-party Python libraries
- Converting real-world data into usable digital outputs

This project also reflects how Python can be used to build simple yet practical applications.

## Features
- Generates QR codes from a given text or URL
- Saves the generated QR code as a PNG image
- Uses external Python libraries for QR generation
- Produces a scannable and shareable output

## Technologies Used
- Python
- qrcode library
- Pillow (PIL)

## How It Works
The application takes a Google Drive link as input data and encodes it into a QR code.  
Once executed, the program generates a PNG image file containing the QR code, which can be scanned using any QR scanner to open the linked resource.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install the required dependency:
2. Run the Python script:
3. The QR code image will be generated and saved in the project directory.

## Output
- A QR code image file (`my_qr_code.png`) is created.
- Scanning the QR code opens the Google Drive link containing the Python completion certificate.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
- How to install and use external Python libraries
- How QR codes work and how to generate them programmatically
- How to structure a simple Python project
- How to convert a digital resource into a scannable format

## Future Enhancements
- Accept user input dynamically
- Customize QR code colors and size
- Embed a logo inside the QR code
- Generate multiple QR codes in a single run
